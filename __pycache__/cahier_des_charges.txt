Requirements Specification — Student Performance Monitoring and Analysis System

1. Context and Objectives
- Context: Desktop application (Tkinter) for schools, using a MySQL database under XAMPP.
- Objectives:
  - Centralize user management (administrators, teachers, students).
  - Track academic performance (marks, subjects, trends).
  - Provide dashboards and comparative analytics.

2. Scope
- In scope: Authentication, roles, student/teacher management, subjects, marks, dashboards (admin/teacher/student), search/filter, password reset, key statistics.
- Out of scope (phase 1): PDF/Excel export, email notifications, multi-institution tenancy, SSO, mobile.

3. Roles / Personas
- Administrator: Manages users and master data, supervises global statistics.
- Teacher: Views/enters marks by subject, reviews trends for classes.
- Student: Views personal marks and trends.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Authentication
- Login via username and password (SHA-256 hashed).
- Redirect to role-based dashboard (admin/teacher/student).
- "Forgot password": retrieve email and reset password.

4.2 Administrator Dashboard
- Stat cards: number of active students, active teachers, subjects, average marks.
- Charts: gender distribution, performance by subject, time trends.
- Top 3 students (based on average/estimated CGPA).

4.3 Student Management
- List: ID, Name, Email, Phone, Gender, Status, Enrollment Date.
- Search/filter by name, email, ID.
- Add a student (required fields):
  - username (unique), password, fullname, email (unique), phone, date_of_birth (YYYY-MM-DD; accept DD-MM-YYYY → normalize), gender (Male/Female/Other), address, status (Active/Inactive/Graduated).
  - Rules: username uniqueness (users), email uniqueness (students), validation of required fields, date format check.
  - Effect: creates a user with role "student" + student profile.
- Edit student: fullname, email, phone, date_of_birth, gender, address, status.
- Delete student: delete student profile (cascade to marks if FK is configured).
- View marks (dialog; placeholder acceptable in phase 1).

4.4 Teacher Management
- List: ID, Name, Email, Phone, Department, Qualification, Status.
- Search/filter by name, email, department.
- Add/Edit/Delete a teacher (creates a user with role "teacher").

4.5 Subjects
- List/add/edit/delete subjects: name, code, associated teacher.

4.6 Marks
- Enter/edit marks per student and subject: total_marks, marks_obtained, exam_date.
- Calculations: averages, percentages, estimated CGPA.

4.7 Teacher Dashboard
- Performance by subject, trends, results distribution.

4.8 Student Dashboard
- Personal view: marks by subject, trends, averages.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Platform: Windows 10+, Python 3.x, Tkinter (GUI), MySQL via XAMPP.
- Dependencies: mysql-connector-python, matplotlib (optional), ttk, hashlib.
- Database: utf8mb4 charset/collation, autocommit enabled.
- Performance: list loads < 1s for ~5k records; CRUD operations typically < 1s.
- Security: SHA-256 password hashing, role-based access control, basic validations.
- UX: maximized window, filterable tables, modal dialogs for CRUD.
- Logging: clear user-facing error messages; console logs for DB errors.
- Accessibility: readable fonts, sufficient contrast.

6. Data Model (simplified)
- users(user_id PK, username UNIQUE, password, role ENUM('admin','teacher','student'), created_at)
- students(student_id PK, user_id FK→users, fullname, email UNIQUE, phone, date_of_birth DATE, gender ENUM('Male','Female','Other'), address, enrollment_date, status ENUM('Active','Inactive','Graduated'))
- teachers(teacher_id PK, user_id FK→users, fullname, email UNIQUE, phone, department, qualification, hire_date, status ENUM('Active','Inactive'))
- subjects(subject_id PK, subject_name, subject_code UNIQUE, teacher_id FK→teachers)
- marks(mark_id PK, student_id FK→students, subject_id FK→subjects, teacher_id FK→teachers, total_marks, marks_obtained, exam_date DATE)

7. Business Rules
- Uniqueness: username (users), email (students/teachers), subject_code (subjects).
- Deletions: if no ON DELETE CASCADE, block deleting a student when linked marks exist; otherwise cascade.
- Statuses: only "Active" students/teachers count for specific statistics.
- Date normalization: accept DD-MM-YYYY and convert to YYYY-MM-DD on save.

8. Flows and Acceptance Criteria
- Login: with valid credentials, user is redirected to the dashboard for their role.
- Add student (Admin):
  1) Admin → Manage Students → "Add Student".
  2) Enter all required fields (accept DD-MM-YYYY format).
  3) If username/email already exist → clear error message.
  4) On success → confirmation message + refresh list and statistics.
- Delete student (Admin): confirmation, delete in DB, refresh list and statistics.
- Dashboards: show cards and charts without errors; show informative messages when no data.

9. Constraints and Dependencies
- XAMPP (MySQL) must be running; database "student_performance_db" created per database_setup.sql.
- Offline environment acceptable (advanced charts optional if matplotlib is missing).

10. Test Plan
- Unit: DB functions (CRUD), password hashing, aggregate queries.
- Integration: Add/Edit/Delete student/teacher flows, post-login redirections.
- UI: field validations, modal dialogs, filters, table refresh.
- Data: uniqueness checks, date formats, FK constraints.

11. Deliverables
- Source code, SQL scripts, requirements.txt, README, this requirements specification (TXT).

12. Schedule (indicative)
- Week 1: Data model, auth, base screens.
- Week 2: Student/teacher management, full CRUD.
- Week 3: Marks, basic stats, dashboards.
- Week 4: Stabilization, testing, documentation.

13. Risks
- MySQL/XAMPP unavailability, schema misalignment, large data volumes.
- Dependency on matplotlib for some charts (optional).

14. Glossary
- CGPA: index derived from average via bands.
- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
